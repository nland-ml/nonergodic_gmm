# nonergodic_gmm
 
A Matlab implementation of the nonergodic ground motion model used in [1]. This repository does not include the data needed to run the experiments. It also needs the gpml library available at https://github.com/shubiuh/GPML.

See also https://github.com/NHR3-UCLA/ngmm_tools for a related (and more recent) implementation.
